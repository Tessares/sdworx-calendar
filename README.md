SDWorx Calendar Merger
======================

This is a simple script, quickly written, to improve the .ics file generated by
SDWorx: if someone is off for multiple days, one even will be created per day
instead of one event for the period. When there are a few people in the
calendar and during the holiday period, that's hard to read.

This script will merge all events that are in sequence (even over the weekend).

Simply use:

    ./sdworx_calendar_merger.py <calendar.ics>

And see the result in `<calendar.ics>.merged.ics`

Feel free to improve the script and propose others ;-)

Encoding
--------

For some calendars, you need to force a Windows encoding:

    cat Calendar.ics.merged.ics | iconv -f utf8 -t iso8859-15 > Calendar.ics.merged.iso.ics
